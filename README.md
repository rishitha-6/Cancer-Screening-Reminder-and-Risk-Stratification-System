# Cancer-Screening-Reminder-and-Risk-Stratification-System

Problem: Build a system that tracks screening schedules and identifies patients who need priority screening based on risk factors.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement risk stratification models for breast, cervical, colorectal cancer using age, family history, lifestyle

Critical Thinking: Understand screening guidelines, balance over-screening vs under-screening, consider patient anxiety

Problem Solving: Handle different screening intervals, risk factor interactions, guideline updates

Modular Structure: Separate screening calendar, risk assessment, guideline engine, and notification system

Clear Architecture: Flow from patient data → risk calculation → screening schedule → reminder generation

Deliverable: Screening management system that prioritizes high-risk patients and manages reminder schedules.
